# Python and SQL 

Create a database using SQLITE3
sqlite3 favorites.db 

.mode [desired mode]
.mode csv
This lets sqlite3 know that we're using a csv file

.import [file] [what you want to call it]
.import favorite.csv favorites
This lets sqlite3 use the existing file and it's headers (lets us skip a few steps for now)

.schema 
This lets us see what just happened, view the layout of the db

SELECT [column/columns] FROM [destination];
This pulls information from our file or wherever we are looking (SQL uses capitals convention)

SELECT * FROM favorites;
Pulls every line from our CSV file turned into a db

* are a wild card character for all

Be careful about what query you type in, and what it requires

ALWAYS ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR database

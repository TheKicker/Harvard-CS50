To characterize a Spotify user's audio aura from their top 100 songs in the songs.db database from 2018, calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability values. These averages reveal whether the user's music taste leans towards energetic, positive, and danceable songs.  One potential problem with characterizing a user's audio aura based solely on average audio features is that it may oversimplify their music preferences, as individual song meanings and personal emotional connections are not considered.

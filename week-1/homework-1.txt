What to Do

Log into code.cs50.io using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
Once your codespace has loaded, close any Welcome tabs that might have opened by default
In Codespace’s terminal, complete the steps under SSH at cs50.readthedocs.io/github/#ssh to configure your codespace for some of CS50’s command-line tools. (You should skip this step if you have already set up your codespace for another CS50 course.)
Log into submit.cs50.io using your GitHub account and click Authorize to activate check50.
Run update50 in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click Rebuild now

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s source code.
See CS50’s style guide for C for tips on how to improve your code’s style.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
make hello
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make hello
instead!

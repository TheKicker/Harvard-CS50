# Lecture 3 - Algorithms

Remember, algorithms are just a list of instructions we go over repeatedly to solve a problem

Computers can't see ALL of the data like a human can

Array = [0,5,7,9,1,4,2,6,8,3]

Humans can look at that and sort of visually see the numbers in order
Computers have to go one item at a time

Fortunately, we have all the building blocks we need to get it done 
- conditionals
- loops
- etc 

Big O takes the longest because every new input adds more time to solve
Ө (N/2) is almost longest
Ө (Log N) is completely independent of how much input there is

Omega symbol is the lower bound of a runtime

The numbers in the locker problem 

Ө(n²)
Ө(n log n)
Ө(n)
Ө(log n)
Ө(1)
